# Roles of certain files:

1. Dependabot Configuration (.github/dependabot.yml): 

This file is for automated dependency management. Dependabot checks the specified directories for outdated dependencies and automatically opens pull requests to update them. This process helps keep dependencies up-to-date, but it doesn’t influence syncing between the company project and the cookie-cutter project.

2. GitHub Actions Workflow 
(.github/workflows/main.yml): This file contains a GitHub Actions workflow, set to trigger on any push or pull_request. The workflow includes steps to:

* Install cookiecutter, create a project directory (Company-Project) from the cookie-cutter template, and run tests on it.
* Build the project Docker image, verify backend configurations, and run tests.

This setup is intended for automated testing of the cookie-cutter template itself, which validates if the generated project structure (Company-Project) builds and tests correctly. It doesn’t directly synchronize changes but is essential for verifying template integrity.

3. Post-generation Hook (hooks/post_gen_project.py): 
This Python script runs after generating a project with cookiecutter. It configures the Docker setup for the generated project by copying environment files and managing frontend directory structures depending on settings (like EXPERIMENTAL_USE_APP_ROUTER). This script modifies the generated project (Company-Project) without affecting the cookie-cutter template, and thus doesn't impact sync1 directly.

4. EditorConfig (.editorconfig): 
This file ensures consistent coding styles across different editors by defining settings such as indentation and charset. It’s relevant for consistent formatting but not related to data syncing.
